# github-learning
A repository for learning to use GitHub.

Hey! this is Jose Ramon, also known by my nickname Carlo.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform used for managing files intelligently through Git, a versioning control system that tracks changes made to files.

# General Workflow of Using GitHub
1. Create a Repository - A repository acts like a folder containing files related to another. Creating a repository is basically means creating a project folder or workspace storing the assets or files related to the project. Include a brief description and tick the checkbox with a description beside it saying to include a readme file.
2. Create a (Replica) Branch - A branch is either the main branch or replica of the main branch. A main branch is the definitive/final copy of the entire project repository, where approved pull requests from replicated branches are merged and reflected in the main branch. Meanwhile, the replica branch serves as the workstation of contributors where editing happens. Such edits will then be committed to save any change made to it and eventually pull a request to request the changes to be merged in the main branch.
3. Edit any file in the replica branch.
4. Commit the changes made in the file.
5. Pull a request - Pulling a request means you are requesting to the reviewers to apply the changes you have made in the replica branch to the main branch.
6. Review the pull request and approve the request to merge in the main branch.

Committing changes via Visual Studio Code.
